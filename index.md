## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/">Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</a> (FCUL), conducting research at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lasige.pt/">LASIGE</a>. I am supervised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~catiapesquita/"> Dr. Catia Pesquita</a> from FCUL.

Interested in Biomedical Artificial Intelligence. I am currently focusing on Explainable AI, researching the application of AI algorithms to explain their decisions and the implementation of AI-driven technologies in the healthcare sector. My goal is to contribute to developing ethical and transparent AI technologies. More specifically, I am working on making deep learning-based drug recommendations for cancer patients more easily understood by clinicians. 

I have previously conducted research in Multi-domain knowledge graph embeddings and Machine Learning algorithms for <a target="_blank" href="https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13326-023-00291-x">gene-disease association prediction</a>.

Currenty conducting research on <a target="_blank" href="https://liseda-lab.github.io/assets/pdf/2025IJCAI_RewardingExplainability"> Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs </a>, with a paper accepted at IJCAI 2025.
